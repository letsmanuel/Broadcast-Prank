This is a broadcast simulation. All information provided in the played video is not real... Or is it...

The video is from Youtube: CodeRed - You are in the wrong year

This application does only play the video in fullscreen as a prank on your friends. No harm is done to your device and if needed the application may be taken down if wished.

This application can be closed using Alt+F4 since it runs as topmost = all apps appear behind it. The taskbar is excluded!


---- NOTE ----
THE PROGRAMM MAY NEED UP TO 1 MINUTE ONCE STARTED THE FIRST TIME DUE TO THE NEED OF DECOMPILING THE VIDEO AND RECOMPILING / PLAYING AS MP4!
